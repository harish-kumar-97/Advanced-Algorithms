/**
 * This is an example program to worst case with linear search
 *
 * Worst case: when the element to be searched (x in the above code) is not present in the array
 * Average case: In average case analysis, we take all possible inputs and calculate computing time 
 *               for all of the inputs. Sum all the calculated values and divide the sum by total number of inputs.(Î˜(n)).
 * Best case: O(1). The best case occurs when the element occurs at the first location.
