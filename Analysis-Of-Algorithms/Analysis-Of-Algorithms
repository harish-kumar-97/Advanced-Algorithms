Analysis Of Algorithms:
----------------------

1. Why performance analysis?
    - Parameters like user friendliness, modularity, security, maintainability, etc can be
      acheived only if we have a better performance.
    - Speed is fun!
    - Performace == scale

2. Idea Of Asymptotic Analysis:
    - Performance of an algoritm is measured in terms of input size, not the running time.
    - To illustrate this taking an example of linear and binary search algorithms.

3. Linear search vs Binary Search:
    - The order of growth of Binary Search with respect to input size is logarithmic [O(log n)] while 
      the order of growth of Linear Search is linear[O(n)].

4. Does asymptotic analysis always work?
    - Depends on the situation. In asymptotic analysis we always talk about the input sizes, there might be a
      possibility that large inputs are never given to your software and an algorithm which is asymptotically slower, 
      always performs better for your particular situation.
